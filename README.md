#### Note:
If the indexes are not up to date with the `dist` branch, you can update them by using [this tool](https://www.jsdelivr.com/tools/purge).

## Adding New Songs

To add a NONG song to the official index, create an issue.

Alternatively, you can add the song to the SFH index, and it will eventually be included in the SFH index.

Also the SFH index is updated daily.
